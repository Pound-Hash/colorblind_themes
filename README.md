These themes are designed for terminal use by green-weak colorblind users. If there are any red-weak users who find these themes unsuitable and would like to help me in designing more, feel free to let me know. I doubt there is much I can do for those rare few whose affected range of colors are the blues and yellows.

I am indebted to Martin Krzywinski at the [Genome Sciences Centre](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/colorblind/palettes.mhtml#page-container) for his work on colorblind color palettes.
